The MOOC.py file contains exercises from the MOOC Fun website, related to the INFO-F101 programming course at ULB. 
However, it is important to note that not all exercises are included in the MOOC.py file. 
In fact, nearly half of the exercises are in the form of multiple-choice questions (QCM) that need to be completed directly on the MOOC Fun website.

The codes present in the MOOC.py file are accompanied by specific instructions which can be found on the MOOC Fun website. 
Therefore, to obtain all the detailed instructions for each exercise, it is necessary to visit the website itself.
